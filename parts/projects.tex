    \skilldesc{Leading a team of 5 students to develop a fully fledged shell in C, including shell scripting, job control. Next to development, I am responsible for management of the team.}
    \skilldesc{As an undegraduate project, I built a coilgun alongside a complete simulation with \texttt{Matlab Simulink} to find optimal parameters for energy efficiency. Final version shot 50g steel bullets at 120km/h}
    \skilldesc{Wrote a kernel from scratch in Rust targeting the \texttt{i386} architecture. I'm responsible for implementing paging, interruptions, x86 devices, PCI and hardware multitasking. I'm still learning and development is ongoing (paused) as a project for 42.}
    \skilldesc{Upkeeping of a media homeserver for family and friends, a 6Tb film library for \textasciitilde{}15 users. I've often used this as an excuse to try out technologies I'm interested in such as \texttt{docker}, \texttt{zfs}, \texttt{prometheus}, \texttt{grafana} etc...}
