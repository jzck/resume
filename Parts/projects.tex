OpenBikes is application for visualizing in real time the number of bikes/spaces in bike stations. The visualization is done with \texttt{LeafletJS} and a lot of JavaScript. The data is scraped (\texttt{Python}), stored (\texttt{MongoDB}) and analyzed (\texttt{sklearn}) in order to make forecast and advise users/cities. The website is live at \textcolor{cyan}{\url{http://openbikes.co/}}.

Together with 70 other students we built a taxi booking software (mobile and web) during two weeks. I was head of the development section and took care of most of the programming decisions. We worked in a very lean way and applied AGILE principles to great success. The project was relayed in the local news; more information is available here: \textcolor{cyan}{\url{http://cmisid.github.io/2016/01/04/TaxiSID.html}}.
