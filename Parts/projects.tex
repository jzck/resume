OpenBikes is application for visualizing in real time the number of bikes/spaces in bike stations. The visualization is done with \texttt{LeafletJS} and a lot of JavaScript. The data is scraped (\texttt{Python}), stored (\texttt{MongoDB}) and analyzed (\texttt{sklearn}) in order to make forecast and advise users/cities. The website is live at \textcolor{cyan}{\url{http://openbikes.co/}}.
